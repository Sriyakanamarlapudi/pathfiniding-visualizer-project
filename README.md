Path Finding Visualizer using react
Problem: Create a path-finding visualizer using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between grid points while navigating obstacles.
Solution: Utilize React to visually represent Dijkstra's algorithm determining the shortest path despite obstacles, showcasing efficient navigation around barriers.
Uses: Demonstrates Dijkstra's algorithm in finding optimal paths amidst obstacles within grid-based scenarios, serving as a learning tool for pathfinding algorithms' efficiency.
Personal Project: Developed a hands-on visualizer using React and Dijkstra's algorithm to showcase obstacle-avoiding pathfinding, providing practical insights into algorithmic problem-solving.
